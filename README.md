# slideCreator
Generates slides based on a PowerPoint template and an Excel spreadsheet.
To start, download the file called slideCreator.xlsm and go through the "Read me" spreadsheet.

With this tool, you can automate the generation of slides that are all in the same format, but differ by some text blocks. I have used it to generate certificates for awarded club members.
In essence, any presentation containing repetitive slides (e.g. projects briefs, status reports, teams mission statements, â€¦) could be created with this tool, if you prefer to manage the content from an Excel table instead of doing tedious work in PowerPoint.
